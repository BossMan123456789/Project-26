Brisket is a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest of beef or veal. The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts, though the definition of the cut differs internationally. The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals. It's tender to the point of falling apart, and so full of smoky flavor. Brisket can be a rather large cut of meat, with a full brisket (sometimes known as a "packer brisket") weighing between 10 and 14 pounds. It actually consists of two muscles that overlap: the "flat," or the "first cut," which is the thinner part, and the "point,"— also called the "deckle point" or the "second cut" — which is the thicker and fattier section of the brisket.
